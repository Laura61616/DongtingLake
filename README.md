Long-term wetland biomonitoring highlights the different impacts of anthropogenically induced factors on regional macroinvertebrate diversity in Dongting Lake, China

Freshwater wetlands, as sentinels of global changes in the Anthropocene, have experienced disproportionate biodiversity loss. However, a lack of long-term biological indicator data limited our understanding of wetland biodiversity dynamics and principal drivers. Here, we combined one of the longest aquatic biomonitoring datasets in China with satellite-derived imagery and spatial-explicit analysis during the most recent portion of the Anthropocene, from 1988 to 2017. Three possible paths were hypothesized, including the "land-water connection," "climate change," and "river-lake connection". The results revealed declining macroinvertebrate alpha diversity but increased beta diversity. An increase in nutrients due to changes in human land-use intensity in the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem was the primary mechanism for the losses of macroinvertebrate species and functional groups. Alpha diversity changes were most influenced by land-use changes in land buffers 1.5 km from the sampling sites, while beta diversity was significantly affected within 50 m. Our results suggest the need to attenuate local land-use effects by establishing protected buffer areas to protect biodiversity in the future.
